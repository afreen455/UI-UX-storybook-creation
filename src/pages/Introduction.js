        <p>Storybook is a development environment for UI components that enables you to create and showcase components in an environment outside your main application. This allows you to work on one module at a time and develop entire UIs without the need for a complex dev stack.

Storybook also enables you to document, reuse, and test user interface components. In addition to that, it makes building web applications faster and more efficient.

The tool has an extensive plugin ecosystem that can help extend and fine-tune your application. Also, it integrates with the most popular JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue, and even Ruby.</p>
